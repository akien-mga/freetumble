## Description

FreeTumble is a free colourful puzzle game for Windows and Linux.
It features 3 game modes, with simple rules but different gameplay.

NORMAL: Click groups of 3 or more stones to make them disappear.
Each time you click a group, a new row will be added. Don't let the stones
reach the top of the grid or you're done, and make a good use of the various
bonus stones available!

MOTION: Pretty much the same as the 'Normal' game, but real time:
the new row will be added after an amount of time (decreasing as the player
level increases).

CLASSIC: Click groups of 2 or more stones to make them disappear.
Try to clear the entire grid to get the best score.
